The following Git contains jupyter notebooks and other workfiles for a 2017 B2B tradeshow event.

The data set driving this analysis is a combination of anonymised CRM data (contact, lead, and opportunity), and event device data (NFC touchpoints representing a variety of information requests from the delegates).

The goal of this model is to predict conversion of a delegate into a business opportunity. 

Specific hypotheses: 
Does event lead scoring predict opportunity creation (interpretive model)?
What behavioural segments are in event device data?

Please contact Geoff Pidcock for a copy of the files.
